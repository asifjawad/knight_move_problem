# Extending the Knight’s moves shortest path: Approach by using latest available resources: A Creative Approach

## Introduction
In the first part of the knight's task, we tackled the classic problem of moving a knight on an empty chessboard from one known cell to another. let’s take it to one step further and consider how we can enhance our solution by adapting various concepts of artificial intelligence and systems domains.

## Leveraging Generative AI or Transformers:
As in this era, this is the trending field and we know it has made the search very simple even for the unknow. 
- we can built our chatbot using custome models to trained the model to produce the output which will produce the result in human speaking languages.

- We can employ a *Variational Autoencoder (VAE)* to learn latent representations of chessboard states. These latent vectors can then be decoded by decoder to efficiently produce the shortest path.

- To enhance the competency and security a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on chess positions can create realistic obstacles. These obstacles could be other knights, rooks, or even mythical creatures.
Our knight must adapt its path based on these dynamically generated obstacles.

- Transformers for example llama, gemini, BERT, GPT performs better at sequence-to-sequence tasks. We can encode the chessboard state and decode optimal knight moves. Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model on chess move sequences to generate intelligent move suggestions.

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning.

### Object Detection:

We can use object detection techniques such as YOLO, DenseNet, Faster, R-CNN to identify pieces (e.g., other knights, pawns, or rooks) on the board by imagining the chessboard as a dynamic environment where pieces move. Once we detected the players, we can track their movements over time. This information could be useful for our knight’s player and it can take the right decision on time.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL):
RL agents learn from interactions with an environment. Let’s train an RL agent to play chess!
Our knight can be the agent, and the chessboard serves as the environment. The reward signal could be reaching the destination cell.
The agent learns optimal moves through exploration and exploitation.


# Systems building: Producing working application


## Docker and Docker Compose:
To ensure that application works perfectly on different environment we can take the help of containerization by using Docker or kubernetes. This ensures the application works with consistent behavior across different environments. we can use Docker Compose or build to manage multi-container applications for our knight's move. we can run multiple sub-process to run the application smooth and faster.

## Machine Learning Pipelines:
Finally after all these hurdels to automate the end-to-end ML process: data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment. Tools like ML FLow, Zen MLFlow, Apache Airflow or Kubeflow Pipelines can help manage complex ML workflows.


## Distributed Architectures:
With the help of technologies such as Apache, Kafka for message passing we can consider distributing the knight’s process computation across multiple nodes. Implement parallel search algorithms such as parallel breadth-first search to speed up pathfinding process.

## AWS Integration:
We can deploy our knight’s moves application on AWS Lambda via API Gateway or an S3 event when a new chessboard configuration arrives. WHich leverage AWS Step Functions for orchestration, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
